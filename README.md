# pysvd
Fluid Flows GUI Classifier using reduced order modelling &amp; classic machine learning


To use the code, you can easily make a folder and copy/paste the pysvd-demo.ipynb to it as well as your train and test image folders.



Then, make a new folder (rename it to ROM) inside the current folder and copy init.ipynb, ROM.ipynb and ML.ipynb to it. 



Now you should be able to run the pysvd-demo.py from the main folder. 



A new window will pop up after you run this file. In the new window, you can localize your train and test image folders in this format:
C:/Users/{your-pc-name}/Desktop/.../{foldername} (Pay attention to the / marks, don't use \ instead)



Afterwards, specify the frames per rate at which your experimental data was captured.



Also, label your train data into subcategories by specifying their names and the number of images inside each. 



Finally, Hit Start and there you go!
